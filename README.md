Lead is a distributed version control system (DVCS); it aims to replace Git.

## Short-term Goals

- Provide a simplified* Git-like experience for version control.
- Furthermore, reach feature-parity with Git with select exceptions (TBD).

## Long-term Goals

- Lead will be self-hosting. No third-party (like GitHub) will be necessary to
  open pull-requests, perform code-reviews, etc. Everything can be performed
  either via HTML (`pb serve localhost:8080`) or on the CLI.
- Lead will not need a full-checkout in 'lazy' mode. Instead blobs and trees will
  be lazy-loaded from any peer providing the SHA256 hash of the object. This is so
  that Lead can adequately host extremely large projects that preclude a
  full-checkout†.

## Can I use Lead yet?

**No.** Major features are in progress or have yet to be implemented.

## Testing, Building, and Installing

Assert you've downloaded the repository and configured your `PATH` and `GOPATH`
correctly.

### Option A: For use

```
$ ./configure && make install
```

### Option B: For development

```
# Install dependencies
$ ./configure

# Running unit tests
$ make test

# Building
$ make build
```

## Contributing

Suggestions, comments, patches and other contributions are welcome. When you
feel as if your contribution is ready, simply open a pull-request. Here are
some basic rules about contributions:

- I have strong notions of unity and harmony of software. This means that I
  may rewrite any patch suggestion, if only to keep the coding style
  consistent, or to better match long-term goals that I have not made explicit.
- If I reject a suggestion, I will normally explain why, though I cannot
  promise that the explanation will be convincing. Even rejected suggestions
  have value, since they force me to put the underlying concepts into words.
- Resulting code uses the BSD-3-Clause license, listing me (and only me) as the
  author. I will still list contributors in a section below.

This contribution guide was inspired by (i.e. stolen from)
[BearSSL's contribution guide][bearssl].

*Git is known to have a bloated, unclear user interface. Such problems have
attempted to be solved in the past by providing new abstractions over Git. Lead
aims to replace Git.

†Companies with monolithic repos and GBs of history (e.g. Microsoft Windows)
cannot realistically be downloaded to a single hard-drive. Even if it could,
forcing each developer to download the complete history would take an incredible
amount of time. See below.
